This price inflation has impacted the economy differently across states, affecting the living conditions of the citizens. This project aims to analyze key economic indicators such as incomes, expenditures, and savings capabilities of Nigerian citizens in response to this surge.

### The Problem

To create a quick-view dashboard that provides in-depth information on the price surge and its effects on the Nigerian economy using data science techniques.

### Goal of the Project

The goal is to present a graphical view of selected items based on basic living needs, including food items, transportation costs, taxation, wages, healthcare, and essential commodities, and to track their price increases. Additionally, the project aims to compare the value of the Nigerian Naira against the US Dollar and analyze how these prices vary over time.
